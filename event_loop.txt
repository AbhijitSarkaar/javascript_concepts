Concepts

1. callback: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-callback-functions-what-are-callbacks-in-js-and-how-to-use-them/
2. events
    https://javascript.info/introduction-browser-events
    https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-events/
    1. events are signal which happens after some action (e.g: mouse click)
    2. events are not part of the core JavaScript. they are part of the browser apis
    3. event handler is a function which runs after a event occurs
    4. Event object is passed to event handler when a event happens on a dom element. The event object contains different properties of the dom element on which the event occurs
3. event delegation (propagation, bubbling, capturing, stopPropagation(), preventDefault(), target, currentTarget)

    (event propagation)

    (event target and currentTarget)

    (event delegation)

    https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-event-delegation/ (how event delegation helps)


    1. event target is the place from which the event is originated (clicked for 'click' event. If a event happens on a stack of elements then target represents the bottommost element). 
    currentTarget is the element which listens to the event (which can be same as target, or an element above the hierarchy)
    2. event delegation is a pattern where a set of elements are represented by a common ancestor
    3. e.stopPropagation() stops the event bubbling up the elements stack
    4. e.preventDefault() is about stopping a default behaviour of an event by the browser (e.g clicking on a checkbox, form submit refresh)
    5. event propagation ihas three phases. capturing (top-down), target phase, bubbling (bottom-up),
    first the event happens on the top level elements all the way to the innermost element, after that the event handler is executed on the target, later the bubbling happens
    6. event bubbling is the default way javascript event propagation happen. for capturing, need to change the boolean flag in addEventListener,
    main thing to note here is events are not listened two times for both capture and bubbling. They are either listened to in capturing mode (by setting boolean flag),
    or in bubbling mode which is the default behaviour
4. asynchronous js
    1. It's needed so that if a operation is needed to be executed and it takes more time to execute (for waiting for action to complete), then using asynchronous js, this block
    of code can be executed later once the operation is completed
    https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/introduction-to-asynchronous-javascript

5. single threaded vs asynchronous js
    1. Each JS engine contains a memory heap, a call stack, an event loop, a callback queue and a WebAPI with HTTP requests, timers, events,
    2. JavaScript language is single-threaded and the asynchronous behaviour is not part of the JavaScript language itself, 
    rather they are built on top of the core JavaScript language in the browser (or the programming environment) and accessed through the browser APIs

6. browser web apis
    1. They are implemented by browser on top of javascript. Can be used for manipulating the web page (dom api) or fetching data from server (fetch api)

thread pooling
callback queue
messsage queue

event loops
