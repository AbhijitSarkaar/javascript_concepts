event loop (events (event.preventDefault()), event bubbling, single thread, asynchronous, web apis, callback queue) 
promise (async-await, try catch)
this (call, apply, bind)
execution context (scope chain)
scope, hoisting, closure
Objects(this, prototypes, methods, prototype Inheritance)
pure functions, side effects and state mutations
IIFE
array - reduce, splice, slice
anonymous functions
js modules
import const, default import
classes
functions and parameters (new, this, function as object, arguments object, first-class functions, higher order functions)
