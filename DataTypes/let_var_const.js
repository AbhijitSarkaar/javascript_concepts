    Concepts
    1. var is global and function scoped. let/const are block scoped
    2. var is hoisted in the top of their scope and initialized with undefined. 
       let/const are also hoisted but it's not initialized
    3. var can be re-declared and updated. let can not be re-declared but it can be updated. const can not be re-declared and updated
    4. const variables must be initialized during declarations
    5. var global scoped variables are properties of global object which is not the case of let and const
