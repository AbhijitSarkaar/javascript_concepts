    Concepts
    1. Wrapper objects are present for number, string, boolean
    2. They are used under the hood when a property is called on the primitive type (number, string, boolean)
    3. Wrapper objects are of global scope
    4. Wrapper object's valueOf() property returns the primitive value which it wraps
    5. Wrapper objects are instantiated by JS Engine only when a property is accessed on a primitive value. The instance 
    is deleted immediately after using it once
    6. Wrapper objects example: String(), Number(), Boolean()
    7. JavaScript treats primitive values as objects when executing methods and properties using wrapper objects
    8. The static methods in wrapper objects can not be used in the instance of the wrapper objects
