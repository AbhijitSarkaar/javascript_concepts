Q. what is dom
A. the browser downloads the html with any references javascript and images, and converts the html into an object (tree format) by using a html parser. 
each element is represented as a node (property of the object?) 

dom is an api (interfact) that is exposed to the languages. dom api contains the document objects with each object represented as the nodes
the programming language can use the dom api to make required changes to the web page (the document/html source seen in browser window)

dom is language agnostic. It does not depend on which language is using it to change the web page

Q. what is document in dom? Is it a interface
A. It has two meanings. 
   First document represents the actual html source that the server serves. 
   Second, the document object of window global object in browsers, which can have properties (body (returns the body)) and methods (getElementById). 
   It's the object oriented version of the html source

Q. How is dom created?
A. Using a html parser which converts the html to object

Q. what is dom manipulation
A. It's editing the elements of the document

Q. what is virtual dom 
A. It's a javascript object which represents the dom. https://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/

Q. What is shadow dom
A. It's the smaller dom parts which encapsulates certain dom subtree and it's styles and represents only that's necessary. E.g a custom html tag <video />
The global styles using same classname can't change the shadow element's styles

Q. Elaborate more on document object of window object on browser
A. 
typeof window.document is an object
window.document contains different properties such as 
reload (reload the page)
getElementById (getting elements by id), 
body (body itself)
contentType (text/html)
URL (current page url)
window.document.__proto__ is HTMLDocument
window.document.body.__proto__ is HTMLBodyElement

Q. Elaborate more on HTMLDocument and HTMLBodyElement
A. 
First read these two links
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document

HTMLDocument inherits from Document class.
HTMLBodyElement inherits from Element class.

Both Document and Element inherits from Node class. Node class inherits from EventTarget class
There exists Window class which also inherits from EventTarget class

Q. Elaborate on tabs in a browser. difference between window and tabs and how window object is used in tabs.
A. 
An window can contain mutiple tabs. When tabs are taken out of a window, then that tab becomes a separate window.
Window class is used to represent the document used in that tab (window.document)
the variable window is exposed to the javascript code
each tab has it's own window object as the document loaded in separate tabs is different. and property defined in one tab
in the window object's constructor is not accessible from another tab


Q. Explain EventTarget, Node, Element, Document classes
A.

Hierarchy:
                              EventTarget (The DOM Interface)
                                    |
                                    |
                                   Node (Represents the Nodes in the DOM)
                                    |
                                 ___|_____
                                |         |
                                |         |
                             Element    Document

EventTarget: It is the DOM class. Element, Document and Window class are the three most used classes which inherits from EventTarget

Node: It is the abstract base class for representing nodes in the dom tree. Element and Document classes is based on Node class. 
There is no object which is Node class's instance. All the objects are usually instance of Element ot Document. 
Node class contains some member functions such as appendChild(), removeChild() etc

Element: It represents the objects that represents elements. For example a <div>, <p> tags. Element class has properties 
such as className, innerText etc

for a <div> element the hierarchy is:
let div = window.document.getElementsByClassName("question-search-metrics")[0]
div.__proto__ => HTMLDivElement => HTMLElement => Element

Document: It is the interface which serves as a entry point to the web page's content. It has document object as it's instance
document object contains properties such as body, title, head, URL etc. It represents the content present in the current tab
