Q. Is Javascript a scripting language or programming language?
A. It's both scripting and programming language because all scripting languages are programming languages

Q. Difference between a scripting language or programming language
A. scripting languages are interpreted and programming languages are compiled

Q. Difference between compilation and interpretation of languages
A. Compilation translates the entire source code into another form which the machine understands. 
    It points all the errors in the source code at once after translating. Once it (the executable code) is error free, it's executed by the machine

    interpretation takes a program, reads it line by line. For every line, it translates the line into machine understandable code
    and executes it straight away. If a error is encountered then the next line is not executed
    
Q. Engine names of browsers
A. V8 - Chrome, Spidermonkey - Firefox, Chakra - IE

Q. What is a javscript engine
A. It's a computer program that executes js code

Q. What are the components of javascript engine?
A. Call stack and heap

Q. Bytecode and Machine code
A. Byte code is a intermediate form between source code and machine code. It needs a interpreter to get converted to the machine code (binary) which the cpu understand

Q. Just in time compilers
A. The main goal is to improve the performance
Just in time compilers are used to converting the source code/bytecode to machine code on the fly
